whelm the lords of the three rivers, because being home gods,
though small, they were immortal.</p><p>And still the home gods spread their hands across their rivers,
with their fingers wide apart, and the waters rose and rose, and
the voice of their torrent grew louder, crying: "Are we not Eim�s,
Z�n�s, and Seg�strion?"</p><p>Then Mung went down into a waste of Afrik, and came upon the
drought Umbool as he sat in the desert upon iron rocks, clawing
with miserly grasp at the bones of men and breathing hot.</p><p>And Mung stood before him as his dry sides heaved, and ever as
they sank his hot breath blasted dry sticks and bones.</p><p>Then Mung said: "Friend of Mung! Go, thou and grin before the
faces of Eim�s, Z�n�s, and Seg�strion till they see whether it be
wise to rebel against the gods of Pegana."</p></div> </div>
