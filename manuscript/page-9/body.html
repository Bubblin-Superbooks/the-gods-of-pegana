<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Preface</h3><p class="  start-chapter">In the mists before THE BEGINNING, Fate and Chance cast lots to
decide whose the Game should be; and he that won strode through
the mists to MANA-YOOD-SUSHAI and said: "Now make gods for Me, for
I have won the cast and the Game is to be Mine." Who it was that
won the cast, and whether it was Fate or whether Chance that went
through the mists before THE BEGINNING to MANA-YOOD-SUSHAIâ€”<em>none
knoweth.</em></p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
