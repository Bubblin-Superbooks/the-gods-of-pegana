panted a man stepped over his stream, and Seg�strion said: "It is
the foot of a man that has passed across my neck, and I have sought
to be greater than the gods of Pegana."</p><p>Then said the gods of Pegana: "It is enough. We are the gods of
Pegana, and none are equal."</p><p>Then Mung sent Umbool back to his waste in Afrik to breathe again
upon the rocks, and parch the desert, and to sear the memory of
Afrik into the brains of all who ever bring their bones away.</p><p>And Eim�s, Z�n�s, and Seg�strion sang again, and walked once more
in their accustomed haunts, and played the game of Life and Death
with fishes and frogs, but never essayed to play it any more with
