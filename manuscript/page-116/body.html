should speak the hopes of the people, and tell the people that
their hopes be true?"</p><p>The false prophet saith: "Upon the morrow the king shall speak to
thee."</p><p>Shall not I say: "Upon The Morrow the gods shall speak with thee
as thou restest upon Pegana?"</p><p>So shall the people be happy, and know that their hopes be true
who have believed the words that they have chosen a prophet to say.</p><p>But what shall know the Prophet of the gods, to whom none may come
to say: "Thy hopes are true," for whom none may make strange signs
before his eyes to quench his fear of death, for whom alone the
chaunt of his priests availeth naught?</p><p>The Prophet of the gods hath sold his happiness for wisdom, and
hath given his hopes for the people.</p></div> </div>
