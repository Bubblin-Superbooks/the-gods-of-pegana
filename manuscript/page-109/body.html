"Wherefore wouldst thou know the secret of the gods that not the
gods may tell thee?</p><p>"When the wind blows not, where, then, is the wind?</p><p>"Or when thou art not living, where art thou?</p><p>"What should the wind care for the hours of calm or thou for
death?</p><p>"Thy life is long, Eternity is short.</p><p>"So short that, shouldst thou die and Eternity should pass, and
after the passing of Eternity thou shouldst live again, thou
wouldst say: 'I closed mine eyes but for an instant.'</p><p>"There is an eternity behind thee as well as one before. Hast thou
bewailed the aeons that passed without thee, who art so much
afraid of the aeons that shall pass?"</p></div> </div>
