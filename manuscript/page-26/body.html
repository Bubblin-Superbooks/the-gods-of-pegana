his way.</p><p>Never hath Sish stepped backward nor ever hath he tarried; never
hath he relented to the things that once he knew nor turned to
them again.</p><p>Before Sish is Kib, and behind him goeth Mung.</p><p>Very pleasant are all things before the face of Sish, but behind
him they are withered and old.</p><p>And Sish goeth ceaselessly upon his way.</p></div> </div>
