of the gods, roar horribly among the Worlds; and Time, the hound
of the gods, shall bay hungrily at his masters because he is lean
with age.</p><p>And from the innermost of Pegana's vales shall the bird of doom,
Mosahn, whose voice is like the trumpet, soar upward with
boisterous beatings of his wings above Pegana's mountains and the
gods, and there with his trumpet voice acclaim THE END.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Then in the tumult and amid the fury of their hound the gods shall
make for the last time in Pegana</p></div> </div>
