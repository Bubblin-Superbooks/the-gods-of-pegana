the waters and grinned across them at the rebellious home gods.</p><p>And whenever Eim�s, Z�n�s, and Seg�strion stretched out their
hands over their rivers they saw before their faces the grinning
of Umbool; and because the grinning was like death in a hot and
hideous land therefore they turned away and spread their hands no
more over their rivers, and the waters sank and sank.</p><p>But when Umbool had grinned for thirty days the waters fell back
into the river beds and the lords of the rivers slunk away back
again to their homes: still Umbool sat and grinned.</p><p>Then Eim�s sought to hide himself in a great pool beneath a rock,
and Z�n�s crept into the middle of a wood, and Seg�strion lay and
panted on the sand—still Umbool sat and grinned.</p></div> </div>
