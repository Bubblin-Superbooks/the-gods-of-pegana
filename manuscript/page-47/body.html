that he may be still no more.</p><p>The footfall of Roon hath been heard at evening outside the houses
of men, and thenceforth comfort and abiding know them no more.
Before them stretcheth travel over all the lands, long miles, and
never resting between their homes and their graves—and all at the
bidding of Roon.</p><p>The Mountains have set no limit against Roon nor all the seas a
boundary.</p><p>Whither Roon hath desired there must Roon's people go, and the
worlds and their streams and the winds.</p><p>I heard the whisper of Roon at evening, saying: "There are islands
of spices to the South," and the voice of Roon saying: "Go."</p><p>And Roon said: "There are a thousand home gods, the little gods
that sit before the hearth and mind the fire—there is one Roon."</p></div> </div>
